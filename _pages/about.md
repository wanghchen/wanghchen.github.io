<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Huanchen Wang. I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong (<a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/">CityUHK</a>) from Sep. 2022 under CityU-SUSTech Joint PhD Programme, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://luzhc.github.io/">Zhicong Lu</a> (from George Mason University, previously at CityUHK), Prof. <a href="https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~mayx/">Yuxin Ma</a> (from Southern University of Science and Technology), and <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhichalu/">Zhichao¬†Lu</a> (CityuHK). I am a member of DEER Lab and DVA Lab.

I received my BEng degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology (<a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/">SUSTech</a>) in July, 2022, under the supervision of Professor [Xuan Song](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/songxuan.html).

My current research primarily focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in the context of Creativity Supporting and Human-AI Collaboration, particularly as it relates to [Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH)](https://ich.unesco.org/en/what-is-intangible-heritage-00003). I am also interested in Interactive Visual Analytics, with a focus on Explainable AI (XAI) and multi-modal models.

<!-- I have published several papers at the ACM CHI.-->
